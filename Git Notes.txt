	Not sure the correct way to do this, but this is A way.
	First create a new repo on Github.com
	Then create a folder with the rest of the repos on your machine

	Perform the following actions:
		echo "# test" >> README.md
		git init
		git add README.md
		git commit -m "first commit"
		git remote add origin [the URL of your repo on Github]

	At this point, you should have a properly set up repo
